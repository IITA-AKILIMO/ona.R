Making maps using formhub.R
========================================================

formhub.R makes is easy to download and work with datasets on [formhub](http://formhub.org). In this showcase, I'll show off how formhub.R makes it easy to make printable maps... similar to the ones available on formhub.org for you to view.

This time, we'll be using a water point dataset. I am not at liberty to show you the full dataset, but maps aren't a problem. Plus, that gives me an excuse to demonstrate how formhub.R can import datasets from a file. The inputs required are two files, the `csv` file that makes up your data and the `form.json` file, which is a convenient representation of the XLSform used to collect data in the first place.
