Changes in formhub.R 0.0.3.1 (May 24, 2013):

 * `formhubData`, the class of objects that formhub* functions return, is now inherited from data.frame, and the @data property has been removed. What this means is that you can do ordinary data.frame operations (example: `head`, `names`, `nrow`) on formhubData objects, which makes usage more convenient.
 * Demo files have been updated to reflect the change above.
