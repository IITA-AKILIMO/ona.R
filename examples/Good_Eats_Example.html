<h1>A simple example using formhub.R &ndash; good eats</h1>

<p>formhub.R makes is easy to download and work with datasets on formhub.R. After downloading, formhub.R post-processes your dataset to convert the different columns to the correct type, which it derives from the <code>type</code> you specified during the creation of your XLSform.</p>

<p>Let us illustrate this with a simple example:</p>

<pre><code class="r">source(&quot;../formhub.R&quot;)
# Download the dataset named good_eats in the account of mberg NOTE: We
# need to @data to retrieve the dataframe from the return object
good_eats &lt;- formhubDownload(&quot;good_eats&quot;, &quot;mberg&quot;)@data
</code></pre>

<p>The downloaded data has its fields converted to the right types, something we&#39;ll look at in depth later. Before we do that, lets present a quick example of the power of these conversions by looking at dates. Can we look at how much data mberg has been submitting over time?</p>

<pre><code class="r">library(ggplot2)
qplot(data = good_eats, x = submit_date) + ylab(&quot;Submission Count&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p><img src="figure/plot1.png" alt="plot of chunk plot1"/> </p>

<p>How about riskiness of the food he is trying and reporting about&hellip; has that changed over time?</p>

<pre><code class="r">qplot(data = good_eats, x = submit_date, fill = risk_factor)
</code></pre>

<p><img src="figure/plot2.png" alt="plot of chunk plot2"/> </p>

<p>Looks like it has! mberg&#39;s getting riskier as time goes on.</p>
