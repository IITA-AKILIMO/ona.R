<h1>formhub.R</h1>

<p>formhub.R is a library for making reading data form http://formhub.org into R easier.</p>

<p>At the moment, it has the following features:
 * One command download of formhub.org data -- both public and private
 * Casting of data to the right type, based on the type of the input field in XLSform
   * <code>select one</code> fields are converted to factors
   * <code>integer</code>/<code>decimal</code> converted to numerics
   * <code>date</code> fields (including <code>today</code>), and <code>datetime</code> fields (including <code>start</code> and <code>end</code>) are converted to lubridate instants [timezone information is discarded at the moment]
   * TRUE / FALSE fields created out of <code>select multiple</code> options are converted into booleans
 * removeColumns convenience function that removes columns based on matching the title with a regular expression
 * 'extra-schema' over-ride. This helps provide a type to <code>calculate</code> fields if that is desired; automagically calculating the type of a calculate field is not in the short-term feature list</p>
